          Garrett has trained to work at the Happiest Place on Earth, he was also a mechanic with a passion for classic cars, and now as a trained web/software developer putting his creativity to use with his design skills. From a very young age Garrett always blazed his own trail. A true entrepreneur at heart; he started his first black market candy business in 4th grade - only to be stopped by the feds in 5th grade. His father, being passionate in the automotive industry allowed Garrett to be hands-on and explore the world of reverse engineering by taking everything apart in the house, including dad's lawn mower (sorry Dad!).

          Outgoing might be a bit of an understatement. Garrett spent his early education years as a participant in all forms of the arts, especially drama class. It has enabled him to be a well rounded public speaker that can be heard all the way from the back of the room. In high school, he began to explore in-depth with art design and film photography. This exploration led to many of the hobbies that he still participates in today.
